**PROHOTKEYS**

Hotkeys configurations to make more ergonomic the labor of programming.
It applies a series of hotkeys divided by two layers that work as switches using both keys 
that are to the right side of the spacebar.
It's probably due that how keys are assigned that these scripts will work only on systems with English layout.
 
Mac implementation needs Karabiner and Windows needs Autohotkey.
